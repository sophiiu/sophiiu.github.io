      <article class="main"><p>This is one of my portfolio posts and projects I am proud of.</p>
<p>Dragon&rsquo;s Den is a popular TV show where you introduce a product or service, and the dragons, or investors, decide if they want to invest or not.</p>
<p>My class was assigned to do a project like this, where we make a product or service and then show it to the dragons and they decide if they want to invest.</p>
<p>Following this, will be my group and I&rsquo;s story throughout this project, copy and pasted from my post. Malak and Iliana are my group members.</p>
<p>I am posting my Dragon’s Den experience and about notable things that happened, whether it be good or bad. I am also technically posting my product / service my group and I made for this product. It is called Joy Jars and when you buy a jar, part of the profit goes to Foster Care charities, in short. This project is about making a business and then presenting it to the Dragons, and the experience we gain from it. We took 3 weeks on the product, and I was in a group with Iliana, Malak, and I.</p>
<p>When we planned the initial product, Joy Jars was just an idea we liked then scrapped, and then we moved into a coffee shop type service, but that was soon scrapped. After it, was a journey from arguments to agreement, and eventually we came onto a compromise and did the Joy Jars idea, but we added the service part, which was the foster care charity part of the product. But now, it was a time scramble. Everyone was so ahead already, and we just planned the idea. I made the ad and logo overnight, while we also brainstormed ideas for the jars, and how we can decorate it.</p>
<p>Then the ad was done, and it was time to actually put time in the jars. Each of us took a jar home, and decorated it. Iliana and I did a toy jar, and Malak did the tea jar.</p>
<p>Then was the slideshow. I edited the photos and Iliana complied them together. Malak printed photos of the logo out, and made a pretty pastel background for the real life jars we can use while presenting. Iliana finished the script around this time.</p>
<p>After that, we practiced presenting to Mr. Wood, twice actually. I don’t know why we did it twice, but alright.</p>
<p>And that was it. We were done our project. Now it was time for the presentation itself, which was probably the most scary part for the group. ( AND CAUSE MR. WOOD MADE US THE FIRST GROUP TO PRESENT! &gt;:( )</p>
<p>But now, the presentation came. It was actually kinda calming. We showed them the jars, answered the questions, (one stumped us a bit but we managed!) and even got a deal! At one point our ad blasted&hellip; In the middle of Malak speaking. Oops.</p>
<p>Some challenges we faced were definitely all the different ideas and ideal product/service. I wanted to do design and not a coffee shop, Malak wanted a coffee shop, and then it went to her wanting jars in the product, and Iliana wanted a service. We argued a lot, went through different ideas and then we finally decided on an idea we all liked. It wasn’t perfect, but it was something we were all okay with atleast.</p>
<p>Another challenge was the time crunch. Our group drama made us extremely behind, and we had to rush our products and such.</p>
<p>A success is actually how we dealt with the time crunch! We finished in time and actually had extra time as well, so I say we were definitely successful when it came to the time management.</p>
<p>Another success was the jars! The jars were all nice, (Malak’s being the best LOL) and had their own charm to it.</p>
<p>I enjoyed doing the design part for sure!!! Making the ad on After Effects, and making the logo on IbisPaint was kinda scary from the pressure, but it was fun. The logo and ad came out well, (the ad was kinda more to the goofy side though, but in my defense my head was empty.)</p>
<p>Something to change about the project&hellip; Hmm..I think giving us more time would be good, because when making it I noticed Malak had lots of big ideas, that we could actually manage to do if we had more time, but I guess I don’t have anyone to blame except for myself. I would think also maybe change the way the project is introduced to us, mainly cause when Mr. Wood initially introduced it, I was very worried cause it seemed so scary.</p>
<p>I think I will use the experience for the future. This project is great for improving public speaking skills, and lots of creative aspects. I am sure these skills will be useful, especially the public speaking skill one because I was a bit worried and nervous. A takeaway I had was some of the questions. I think we were prepared on the most part, but some questions noticeably stumped us, and I was sure you could tell from the audience, the question I am talking about is the “How much does it cost to make these products?” and some others.</p>
<p>Somethings I will do differently is definitely the ad. I liked the ad, and it had its own humour to it, but I think I should have made it more professional, and maybe even look at ads for inspiration. I think I should have also interacted more with my group, since I was kinda an outsider since Iliana and Malak were already friends, and sometimes we didn’t get along.</p>
<p>I learned that public speaking isn’t as scary as it seems, and that I should have more faith in others. I initially thought that I wanted to do practically everything in the project, but from the start of the 3 weeks to now, my mindset have greatly changed from that, and I no longer think like that.</p>
<p>I also learned that making logos are sometimes hard. You want to make a good logo that represents your company, a logo that gives the feeling you want to emit, and sometimes that can be challenging, but I think I now get the idea of logos now.</p>
<p>I think if I had to rate our group, I would rate it a 2 at the start. Maybe even a 1, but now I think it’s a 3 or 3.5. During the project, sometimes we still fought but we came to a compromise and all gave out ideas. I am proud of that.</p>
<p>In these photos, it shows what is inside the jars, and the jars itself. (Excluding Malak’s since we can’t open it.) The one with the car, that’s the Toy Jar Iliana made, and the one with the watch is the Toy Jar I made. The photos also shows our logo as well.</p>
<p>The photos aren&rsquo;t displayed here, but I will give a link to the photos. This was also edited and revised.</p>
